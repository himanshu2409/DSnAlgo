Interview 1

Round 2 (Coderpad):

Given a log file as some array of strings in a specified format where each line begins with an IP address. You have to find the most frequently occurring IP.

Given a 2-D String array of student-marks find the student with the highest average and output his average score. If the average is in decimals, floor it down to the nearest integer.

Round 3
Given a custom HashMap, in which only equals() method was overridden, he made small changes in the code, and I was expected to give the number of entries in HashMap after each change.
Asked the internal working of HashMap in detail.
